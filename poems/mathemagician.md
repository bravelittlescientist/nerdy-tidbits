## Mathemagician Memory Allocation Poem

_Composed, not sure why, during my undergrad senior year OS class._
_Originally intended to become an epic poem of sorts._
_Probably for the best that I kept my dayjob :)_

> "Oh, silly fail_alloc," the mathemagician exclaimed,
>
> "Stop crashing the system, it's really quite lame!"
>
> Sobbed poor fail_alloc, corrupted heap in its heart,
>
> "I want to save the memory, but where do I start?"
>
> Oh triumph! Suddenly fail_alloc did cry,
>
> "Could it be, mathemagician, that I've freed pointers twice?"
>
> To which the mathemagician sagely suggested,
>
> "Don't mistreat your memory, it's just not very nice!"
